# Library Management System - TDT4100 Project Assignment

This project was part of the assessment of the course TDT4100 Object-Oriented Programming at NTNU, Spring 2022.

The project is an implementation of a library management system. The functionality is built around a traditional library where you can register users in order to conduct various tasks such as loan and deliver books. As admin, the user gets a variety of functions like add/remove books, restock inventory and get a list of all registered users.
